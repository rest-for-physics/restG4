#### Detector geometry

This example implements a small empty lead box, size 10x10x10cm3 and 2mm thickness, which covers a detector of size 6x6x3cm3 filled with xenon at 1bar.

#### Event generator
The event generator will produce Pb210 isotope decays from the lead volume.

#### Testing the example
This example will generate the full Pb210 chain and it will register only the events that produce events in the (0,10)keV range inside the Xenon detection volume.

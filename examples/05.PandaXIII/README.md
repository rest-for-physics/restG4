The following example has been extracted from the pipeline validation at the main framework, where
the full data processing Montecarlo chain is validated.

We use Xe136bb0n.rml to run restG4 for Geant4 simulation. Use ValidateG4.C to check if the simulation
goes smoothly. i.e. all 500 events are simulated and metadata is correctly recorded. The output file will
be used later on

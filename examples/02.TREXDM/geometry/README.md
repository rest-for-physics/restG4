This geometry was extracted from the [trexdm-geometry](https://lfna.unizar.es/gifna/trexdm-geometry) project. Check there for the most official and updated TREX-DM geometries.

These files define a very basic geometry without great detail but integrating the most important components.

- Complete enclosing vessel

- Mylar cathode

- Field cage

- Micromegas supports.

- Target gas volume filling any empty space inside the vessel

The file `description.pdf` shows a quick visualization and geometrical parameters used in each component.
